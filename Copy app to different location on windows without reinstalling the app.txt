>>robocopy "source path" "destination path" /sec /move /e


>>mklink "source path" "destination path" /j




1) Robocopy:

robocopy is a robust file copy command-line tool available in Windows.
"source" and "destination" are placeholders for the paths of the source directory 
and the destination directory, respectively.
/sec copies the security attributes of files and directories.
/move moves files and directories (deletes them from the source after copying).
/e copies subdirectories, including empty ones.

the command robocopy "source" "destination" /sec /move /e will copy all files and
directories (including their security attributes) from the source to the destination,
move them (delete from source after copying), and include all subdirectories.




2.Mklink:

mklink is a command used to create symbolic links or junction points in Windows.
"source" and "destination" are placeholders for the paths of the symbolic link and
the target directory, respectively.
/j creates a directory junction (symbolic link for directories).
So, the command mklink "source" "destination" /j will create a symbolic
link (junction point) at the specified source location, pointing to the destination directory.






To put it into context:

The robocopy command will copy/move files and directories from one location to another.
The mklink command will create a symbolic link (junction point) at a specified location,
pointing to another directory.
By combining these commands, you can effectively move files and directories to a different
location while leaving a symbolic link behind to maintain compatibility with existing paths or references.
