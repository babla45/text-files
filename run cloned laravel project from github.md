To run a Laravel project after cloning it from GitHub, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Run the following command to clone the project:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

---

### **2. Navigate to the Project Directory**
Change to the directory where the project was cloned:
```bash
cd <project-folder>
```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install the necessary PHP dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

If `composer` is not installed, [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) first.

---

### **4. Set Up Environment Variables**
1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and configure database and application settings (e.g., database name, username, password).

---

### **5. Generate an Application Key**
Run the following command to generate a new key for the application:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

---

### **6. Set Up the Database**
1. Create a database in your database management system (e.g., MySQL).
2. Update the `.env` file with the database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

---

### **7. Run Migrations**
Run migrations to create database tables:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

If the project includes seeders for dummy data, use:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

---

### **8. Install Frontend Dependencies (if applicable)**
If the project uses frontend tools like Laravel Mix, install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

To compile assets, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### **9. Start the Development Server**
Run the Laravel development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application will be accessible at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### **10. Troubleshoot (if necessary)**
- **Missing storage symlink:** Run:
  ```bash
  php artisan storage:link
  ```
- **Cache issues:** Clear caches with:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:clear
  php artisan cache:clear
  ```

---

These steps should get your Laravel project up and running.
