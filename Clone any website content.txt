wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.com


### Breakdown:
1. **`--mirror`**: This option enables mirroring, which is similar to using `-r` (recursive download) but with other settings like timestamping, infinite recursion depth, and preserving symbolic links.
   
2. **`--convert-links`**: Converts the links in the downloaded files to make them suitable for local viewing. For example, it will change absolute URLs (like `http://example.com/page.html`) to relative URLs, so you can view the website properly on your local machine.

3. **`--adjust-extension`**: Ensures that the downloaded files have the appropriate extensions (e.g., `.html`) so that they can be opened locally in a web browser.

4. **`--page-requisites`**: Downloads all files necessary to properly display the web pages, such as images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc.

5. **`--no-parent`**: Prevents `wget` from going to parent directories of the specified site. This ensures you only download from `http://example.com` and not from directories higher up.

6. **`http://example.com`**: The target website URL. Replace this with the actual website you want to clone.

### Full Example Usage
If you wanted to download the entire contents of `http://example.com`, you'd open **Command Prompt** (or any terminal window) and run:

wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.com


### Notes:
- This command is intended for static websites. For dynamic websites (those that rely on databases or server-side scripts), this will only download the static portions (HTML, CSS, JS).
